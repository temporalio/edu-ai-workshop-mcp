    "# Part 1: Making MCP Tools Durable with Temporal Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that you've built an AI application that can chat. But what if you want it to *do things*—check weather, query databases, or interact with your company's systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem: every tool requires custom integration code. You write it once for your app, and can't reuse it elsewhere. Adding a new tool means code changes and redeployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP (Model Context Protocol) solves this.**\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course, you need reliability. When your MCP tools make external calls or run long operations, Temporal handles failures, retries, and state management automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we'll combine MCP and Temporal to build AI agents with powerful, durable tool integrations."

    "\n",
    "From the last workshop, we saw:\n",
    "1. Instructions: Agentic systems solve problems for you on your behalf based on what you tell it what to do in human language. For agents, this defines _how_ the agent should behave and make decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "instructions=\"You are a helpful weather assistant. Provide clear, concise weather information.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tools: How things actually get done. Tools can be local processes (“read this local file and show me the result”) or remote calls (“query this database”).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample tool definition\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tools=[\n",

    "        \"type\": \"function\",\n",

    "        \"parameters\": {...}\n",
    "    }\n",

    "However, there are some limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-definition Constraint**: The system is constrained by its pre-defined tools. \n",
    "- What if you want to use tools without pre-defining them in your application? For example: \n",
    "    1. What if a user wants to check the weather\n",
    "    2. You get the response, \"Sorry, I don't have weather capabilities built in yet\" even though weather APIs exist and are accessible.\n",
    "2. **Making Integration Easier**\n",
    "    1. Each integration has its own description and format\n",
    "    2. You need to maintain different versions of different integrations\n",
    "    3. Adding a new tool means code changes, testing, and redeployment\n",
    "\n",
    "What we need instead is a system where:\n",
    "1. Tools can be discovered dynamically\n",
    "2. Integration is standardized\n",
    "3. Tools can be added without code changes\n",

    "\n",
    "- A protocol that allow LLMs to direct an AI application to invoke external functions\n",
    "- Three main benefits:\n",
    "  - a.) **Custom integrations** - Connect your applications to external services like Slack, Google Calendar, databases, and other systems\n",
    "  - b.) **Portable toolset** - Build your toolset **once** using the MCP standard and use it **everywhere**. For example, create custom coding tools (boilerplate generators, prompt templates, documentation automation) that work across any MCP-compatible IDE or application (e.g VSCode, Windsurf).\n",
    "  - c.) **Open-source MCP servers** - Leverage other open-source MCP servers. If you make an MCP Client, then it will allow your application to connect to other MCP servers developed by third parties.\n",

    "With MCP, tools can present their capabilities to an agentic system and allow for dynamic goal solutions. \n",
