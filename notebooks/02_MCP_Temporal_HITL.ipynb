    "- You build an MCP tool that processes invoices\n",

    "- **You need durable tools**: Tools will be reaching out to databases, APIs, and other external systems. Again, you might get network outages, rate-limitted, the service might go down.\n",
    "- **You need to be able to handle long-running processes**: You can implement a MCP tool as a Worflow, so that the tool can handle multi-step long duration processes.\n",
    "- **You need persistence**: Tools can continue progressing even if the MCP Client or server crashes. The Workflow state will be stored on the Temporal server so the process continues seamlessly.\n",
    "- **You need flexibility**: Tools can be built in any language Temporal supports, so a developer can build agentic capabilities in Go, Java, .NET etc."
